# Pre-registration skeleton (to be completed before Phase 3 and posted to OSF)

Frozen in Phase 0 and 1: symptom set and HPO term exclusions (docs/symptom_crosswalk.csv, audited in
docs/hpo_term_audit.md), curated module scaffolding (docs/curated_pathway_modules.csv), pinned data
versions (docs/data_sources.md), evidence grading policy and weights (configs/evidence_assembly.yaml:
grade A by curated-synopsis provenance with frequency scaling), splits and metrics (configs/evaluation.yaml).

Primary hypothesis: see experiment_design.md section 6.5 (equifinality independence and
convergence indices; sufficiency test by module ablation).

Primary endpoint: macro-averaged AUPRC under the pathway-wise split, proposed model versus the
best of network proximity, knowledge-graph embedding and relational GNN with sigmoid head;
minimum difference 0.05; 95 percent bootstrap interval excluding zero; five seeds by five folds.
Proposed in design version 0.4 and to be confirmed here: the pathway-wise split is the Human-GEM
subsystem hold-out (pathway subsystems only; transport, exchange and isolated bins are not
pathways), scored on pooled held-out predictions and paired with the permuted-label run of the
same split; the curated modules hold 37 perturbations on the monogenic slice and serve the
interpretability overlap instead.

Failure criterion: if the proposed model does not beat the popularity and network proximity
baselines under the disease-cluster grouped split, the architecture is abandoned before ablations
run. (Design version 0.3 named the gene-wise split; it leaks through genes sharing a disease,
design section 6.1.)

Negative controls run with every split: labels permuted within degree strata; degree-preserving
rewiring; grade shuffle; peripheral-event control.

To fill in: Phase 1 counts per symptom and grade (docs/phase1_counts.md); final symptom set after
go/no-go; B5 language model and prompt; number of flux samples per gene; power statement for the
GWAS enrichment test; the open questions 8 to 10 of design section 11 (frequency as weight or target;
subsystem versus curated pathway split; the deterioration-term exclusion).
